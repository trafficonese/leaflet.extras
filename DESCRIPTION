Description: The 'leaflet' JavaScript library provides many plugins some of which
    are available in the core 'leaflet' package, but there are many more. It is not
    possible to support them all in the core 'leaflet' package. This package serves
    as an add-on to the 'leaflet' package by providing extra functionality via 'leaflet'
    plugins.
