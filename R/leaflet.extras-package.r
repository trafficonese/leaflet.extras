#' leaflet.extras: Extra Functionality for 'leaflet' Package.
#'
#' The 'leaflet' JavaScript library provides many plugins some of which
#' are available in the core 'leaflet' package, but there are many more. It is not
#' possible to support them all in the core 'leaflet' package. This package serves
#' as an add-on to the 'leaflet' package by providing extra functionality via 'leaflet'
#' plugins.
